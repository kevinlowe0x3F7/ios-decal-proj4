#LocalEats

## Authors
* Kevin Lowe
* Jeffrey Liu

## Purpose
* LocalEats uses Yelp API to present the user with local restaurants,
which are randomly presented in a Tinder-like manner.

## Features
* Ability to see restaurants nearby based on current location or a
given location
* Ability to save restaurants even with killed app
* Filter and sort restaurants based on price and distance

## Control Flow
* For a first time user, they would be prompted to make an account,
entering a username and password. Once an account is made, the user will now
see the list of restaurants, presented one by one, with some basic
information on the restaurant (name, rating, price, etc.).The user
can decide whether to skip onto the next restaurant or save the restaurant
for later, either by swiping left or right or through buttons on the
screen. Once they are done looking at restaurants, they can go into their
profile and see the restaurants in a saved list.
